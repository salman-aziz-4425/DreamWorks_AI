# Stable Diffusion and Aws-Sagemaker

It seems like you want to create an introduction and update your project diagram for "DreamWorks_AI," including the libraries used.

**Introduction:**

Welcome to the backend of the "DreamWorks_AI" project, where we have deployed a Hugging Face model on AWS SageMaker to bring powerful AI capabilities to your applications.

**Project Diagram:**

Below is an overview of the project architecture:

**Libraries:**

To build and run our project, we've utilized several key libraries:

1. **boto3:** Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows us to interact with AWS services programmatically.

2. **FastAPI:** FastAPI is a modern, fast, web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It's excellent for building robust and high-performance web applications.

3. **uvicorn:** Uvicorn is a lightweight ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server that provides the interface for running FastAPI applications.

4. **PyTorch:** PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework that powers our AI model, enabling us to develop and deploy cutting-edge machine learning solutions.

5. Diffusers is library to use stable diffusion models they basically provide you pipeline.

These libraries, along with our AWS SageMaker deployment and Hugging Face model, form the core components of the DreamWorks_AI project, allowing us to deliver AI-driven solutions to meet your needs.

**Results:**
